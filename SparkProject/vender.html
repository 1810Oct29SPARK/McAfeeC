                <p>The Keller Farmers Market is a casual, open air, seasonal market located by the creek in beautiful Bear Creek Park that offers fresh Texas produce, meats, tamales, baked goods, artisan bread, cheese, salsa, pasta, pickles, jellies and jams, honey, baked goods, prepared foods, pet products and crafts, all from the state of Texas or within 150 miles. KFM is a convenient and safe place for the whole family. After your market visit, enjoy the relaxing walking trails and large parks surrounding the area. Every Saturday from May to late November, the market offers something different – whether it’s the freshest produce, live music, chef demonstrations, or health and wellness presentations – making it is as much a center of commerce as it is for the community to reconnect. Our market is open rain or shine, but may close without prior notice during extreme weather conditions in order to maintain the safety of shoppers and vendors.It’s a great place to bring the kids, throw a Frisbee, and pick up great local food products. Come experience the market. Learn from the farmers and wellness providers. Talk with local artisans. Make your own statement in support of local food!</p>

                <p>The Shed is an open-air pavilion where you can shop from regional vendors who grow, raise, make and produce food. You’ll find a mix of farmers with seasonal produce grown in this climate, ranchers with naturally raised meats, cheese, eggs and honey, and food artisans who make breads, canned and regional/international foods. The Shed also has a handful of arts and crafts vendors throughout the year.

                        Shopping carts are available, and misters and ceiling fans lower the temperature by 15 degrees in the summer months.</p>
