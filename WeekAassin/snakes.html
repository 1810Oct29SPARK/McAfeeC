                <h3>Slippery Snake</h3>
                <p>
                        Python invasion has been particularly extensive, notably across South Florida, where a large number of pythons can now be found in the Florida Everglades. It has been suggested that the current number of Burmese pythons in the Florida everglades has reached a minimum viable population and become an invasive species. Hurricane Andrew in 1992 was deemed responsible for the destruction of a python breeding facility and zoo, and these escaped snakes spread and populated areas into the Everglades. More than 1,330 have been captured in the Everglades. Also, between the years 1996 and 2006, the Burmese python has gained popularity in the pet trade, with more than 90,000 snakes imported into the US.
                        By 2007, the Burmese python was found in northern Florida and in the coastal areas of the Florida Panhandle. The importation of Burmese pythons was banned in the United States in January 2012 by the U.S. Department of the Interior. A 2012 report stated, "in areas where the snakes are well established, foxes and rabbits have disappeared. Sightings of raccoons are down by 99.3%, opossums by 98.9%, and white-tailed deer by 94.1%." Bird and coyote populations may be threatened, as well as the already-rare Florida panther.
                        Burmese pythons also compete with the native American alligator, and numerous instances of alligators and pythons attacking - and in some cases, preying on - each other have been reported and recorded.
